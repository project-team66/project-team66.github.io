        <h2>What is HTML used for?</h3>
        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>The  HTML paragraph element is one of the most common elements and as you might have guessed it defines a paragraph. </p>
       <h3>Line Breaks</h3>
       <p>As with print media, a paragraph creates a line break below it to visually separate it from other paragraphs. This is used to emphasise a semantic separation of content. The same structure is used in a novel or a magazine. </p> 
       <h3>Block Elements</h3>
        <p>Elements that create the spacing below themselves on a page are called block elements. Block elements appear vertically down the left-hand side of a page at least until they are styled by CSS. Examples of block elements are and many more. This feature allows HTML to start separating a webpage into different sections.</p>
        <h3>Headings</h3>
      <p>Paragraphs and headings work in concert to create the majority of the text content of a web page and its structure. HTML has six heading elements, which are numbered 1 through 6. h1 is the most significant and usually contains the title of the content â€“ Not to be confused with the title that appears in the browser tab. h2 represents a subsection. h3 and so on represent identifiers of further subjects in subsections until we get to h6.</p>
